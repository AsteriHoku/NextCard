# NEXT CARD
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Loop scheduling has made an impact in my life and I wish there was an app for it, so I started one. The idea is you have a list of tasks, this works particularly well for routine tasks like housework that need to be completed over and over again. Rather than a set schedule like Monday = dishes, Tuesday = vacuum, you can complete tasks in a loop whenever you have time to do the next thing.

Some days we can't get anything extra done, and some days we could do a dozen things! Plus this way your brain never has to track anything or worry about the to-do list being a mile long. 

Just check whatever card is next, do it, and flip to the next card.

I chose to highlight weight lifting exercises because it has an impact in my own life right now.
